---

As 2022 rolled around I was looking to start some new fun projects and decided it would be a good time to check out and learn some new frameworks. 
After some sleuthing it became pretty apparent Svelte and Sveltekit was going to be the framework of choice to learn and experiment. 

## So What Exactly is Sveltekit?

Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

### This is a test title

Contrary to popular belief, **Lorem Ipsum** is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. 

Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.

### This is a Sample Unoredered List

- First item in the list 
- Have at least a basic understanding of Svelte already. (You can probably follow along regardless, but I’d recommend the Svelte tutorial first if you’re brand-new);
- Third item sucks dick
- Fourth item is swell

### This is a code highlight Sample

```js
<script context="module">
	export const load = async({ fetch, url }) => {
    const posts = await fetch('/api/posts.json')
    const allPosts = await posts.json()

    return {
      props: {
        path: url.pathname,
        fullUrl:url.href,
